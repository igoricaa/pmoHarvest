# Admin/Manager Implementation Progress

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
**Current Phase:** Phase 5 - Testing
**Overall Progress:** 95% Complete

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Backend Foundation (COMPLETE - 100%)

### Types & Utilities ✅
- ✅ Extended `src/types/harvest.ts` with admin CRUD types (~235 lines)
  - User management types (CreateUserInput, UpdateUserInput)
  - Client management types (CreateClientInput, UpdateClientInput, HarvestClientResponse)
  - Project management types (CreateProjectInput, UpdateProjectInput)
  - User assignment types (HarvestUserAssignment, CreateUserAssignmentInput, etc.)
  - **Project assignment types (HarvestProjectAssignment, HarvestProjectAssignmentResponse)** - Fixed TypeScript error
- ✅ Created `src/lib/admin-utils.ts` with comprehensive utilities (~95 lines)
  - Server-side functions: `isAdmin()`, `isManager()`, `isAdminOrManager()`
  - `getManagedProjectIds()` - fetch projects where user is project manager
  - `filterByProjectIds()` - generic client-side filter for managers
  - `canManageProject()` - permission check for managers
  - **Client-side hook: `useIsAdminOrManager()`** - for React components
- ✅ **Code deduplication**: Replaced inline role checks in form components with centralized hook

### Harvest Client ✅
- ✅ Extended `src/lib/harvest/client.ts` with 15 CRUD methods (~300 lines)
  - Users: `createUser()`, `updateUser()`, `deleteUser()` (admin only)
  - Clients: `getClients()`, `getClient()`, `createClient()`, `updateClient()`, `deleteClient()` (admin/manager)
  - Projects: `createProject()`, `updateProject()`, `deleteProject()` (admin/manager)
  - User Assignments: `getProjectUserAssignments()`, `getUserAssignment()`, `createUserAssignment()`, `updateUserAssignment()`, `deleteUserAssignment()` (admin/manager)
- ✅ **Fixed return type**: `getCurrentUserProjectAssignments()` now returns `HarvestProjectAssignmentResponse` instead of `HarvestProjectResponse`

### API Routes ✅
- ✅ Created 8 new API route files (~600 lines total)
  1. `src/app/api/harvest/users/route.ts` - GET, POST (admin only)
  2. `src/app/api/harvest/users/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH, DELETE (admin only)
  3. `src/app/api/harvest/clients/route.ts` - GET, POST (admin/manager)
  4. `src/app/api/harvest/clients/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH, DELETE (admin/manager)
  5. `src/app/api/harvest/projects/route.ts` - Added POST method (admin/manager)
  6. `src/app/api/harvest/projects/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH, DELETE (admin/manager with permission check)
  7. `src/app/api/harvest/projects/[id]/user-assignments/route.ts` - GET, POST (admin/manager with permission check)
  8. `src/app/api/harvest/projects/[id]/user-assignments/[assignmentId]/route.ts` - PATCH, DELETE (admin/manager with permission check)

**Key Pattern**: All routes follow consistent authentication → role check → permission check (managers) → Harvest API call → response

---

## ✅ Phase 2: React Query Hooks (COMPLETE - 100%)

### API Endpoint Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Modified `src/app/api/harvest/user-project-assignments/route.ts`
  - Added `?raw=true` query parameter support for manager filtering
  - Returns raw `project_assignments` data with `is_project_manager` flag
  - Backward compatible (default behavior unchanged)

### Manager Filtering Hook ✅
- ✅ **useManagedProjects()** (~30 lines)
  - Fetches project assignments with `?raw=true` parameter
  - Client-side filtering for `is_project_manager === true`
  - Returns array of managed project IDs
  - 10min staleTime for optimal performance

### Users Hooks (Admin Only) ✅
- ✅ **useUsers()** - Fetch all users with optional `is_active` filter
- ✅ **useCreateUser()** - Create new user with cache invalidation
- ✅ **useUpdateUser(userId)** - Update existing user
- ✅ **useDeleteUser()** - Delete user

### Clients Hooks (Admin/Manager) ✅
- ✅ **useClients()** - Fetch all clients with optional `is_active` filter
- ✅ **useCreateClient()** - Create new client with cache invalidation
- ✅ **useUpdateClient(clientId)** - Update existing client
- ✅ **useDeleteClient()** - Delete client

### Projects Write Hooks (Admin/Manager) ✅
- ✅ **useCreateProject()** - Create new project (invalidates projects + userProjectAssignments)
- ✅ **useUpdateProject(projectId)** - Update existing project
- ✅ **useDeleteProject()** - Delete project

### User Assignments Hooks (Admin/Manager) ✅
- ✅ **useProjectUserAssignments(projectId)** - Fetch assignments for a project
- ✅ **useCreateUserAssignment(projectId)** - Assign user to project
- ✅ **useUpdateUserAssignment(projectId, assignmentId)** - Update assignment
- ✅ **useDeleteUserAssignment(projectId)** - Remove assignment

### Summary ✅
- ✅ Added 4 new query keys to `harvestKeys`
- ✅ Added 14 new type imports
- ✅ Added 17 new hooks (~300 lines total) - **Includes useClient() added post-implementation**
- ✅ All hooks follow existing patterns (simple invalidation, no optimistic updates for admin ops)
- ✅ Manager filtering done via client-side hook (not embedded in useTimeEntries/useExpenses)
- ✅ Cache times: 5min for admin data, 10min for managed projects

**Actual implementation:** 1 API endpoint modification (~10 lines) + 17 hooks (~300 lines) = 310 lines total

### ⚡ Post-Phase 2 Optimizations (COMPLETE) ✅

After completing Phase 2, we performed multiple rounds of deep analysis and implemented critical fixes:

#### Round 1: Performance & Architecture Fixes
**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. ❌ `useManagedProjects()` missing enabled condition → unnecessary API calls for non-managers
2. ❌ `canManageProject()` N+1 queries → 2 API calls per manager request (performance issue)
3. ❌ Missing GET single client endpoint → inefficient data fetching

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. ✅ **useManagedProjects() Fix** - Added session and role checks with `enabled` condition
2. ✅ **Removed canManageProject() Checks** - Deleted from 3 API routes (~40 lines), trust Harvest API
3. ✅ **GET Single Client** - Added endpoint + `useClient(clientId)` hook

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/use-harvest.ts` - Added enabled condition + useClient() hook (~15 lines)
- `src/app/api/harvest/projects/[id]/route.ts` - Removed permission checks (~18 lines deleted)
- `src/app/api/harvest/projects/[id]/user-assignments/route.ts` - Removed checks (~24 lines deleted)
- `src/app/api/harvest/projects/[id]/user-assignments/[assignmentId]/route.ts` - Removed checks (~24 lines deleted)
- `src/app/api/harvest/clients/[id]/route.ts` - Added GET handler (~49 lines added)

**Results:**
- ✅ Fixed critical bug preventing unnecessary API calls
- ✅ 50% performance improvement for managers (1 API call vs 2)
- ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code (~40 lines removed)
- ✅ Added missing single-resource fetch capability

#### Round 2: Code Quality & Best Practices (COMPLETE) ✅

**Comprehensive Code Analysis** - Identified 15 code quality issues across 8 categories:

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Phase 4: Render-Phase Side Effects** - Fixed `time-entry-form.tsx` by moving state updates to `useEffect`
2. ✅ **Phase 4: Error Boundaries** - Created `ErrorBoundary` component to prevent white screen crashes
3. ✅ **Phase 5: Code Deduplication** - Created `useNumericInput` hook (eliminated 87 lines of duplicate code)
4. ✅ **Phase 6: Server-Side Validation** - Added Zod validation to 12 API routes (POST/PATCH endpoints)
5. ✅ **Phase 8: Documentation** - Added comprehensive JSDoc to `useTaskAssignments`, updated CLAUDE.md

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/time-entry-form.tsx` - Fixed render-phase side effects, integrated `useNumericInput`
- `src/components/expense-form.tsx` - Integrated `useNumericInput` hook
- `src/components/error-boundary.tsx` - NEW error boundary component (~47 lines)
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Added error boundary
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added root error boundary
- `src/hooks/use-numeric-input.ts` - NEW shared hook for numeric inputs (~35 lines)
- `src/lib/validation/harvest-schemas.ts` - NEW validation schemas (~250 lines)
- `src/lib/api-utils.ts` - NEW `validateRequest()` utility
- 12 API routes updated with server-side validation

**Lines Modified:**
- Added: ~400 lines (validation schemas, error boundaries, hooks)
- Removed: ~87 lines (duplicate code)
- Net: ~313 lines added

#### Round 3: Optimistic Updates Bug Fix (COMPLETE) ✅

**Critical Bug Discovered:**
- ❌ Optimistic updates stopped working after Phase 2 query normalization
- Time entries/expenses don't show changes until page reload

**Root Cause:**
Query key mismatch caused by `normalizeParams()`:
```typescript
// Query uses params
useTimeEntries({ from: '2024-01-01', to: '2024-01-31' })
// Cache key: ['harvest', 'time-entries', { from: '2024-01-01', to: '2024-01-31' }]

// Mutation updates without params
queryClient.setQueryData(harvestKeys.timeEntries())
// Cache key: ['harvest', 'time-entries', undefined]

// ❌ Keys don't match - UI doesn't update!
```

**Solution Implemented:**
Replaced direct `setQueryData()` calls with wildcard `invalidateQueries()` in 6 mutations:
```typescript
// ✅ Invalidates ALL time entry queries regardless of params
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: [...harvestKeys.all, 'time-entries']
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/use-harvest.ts` - Fixed 6 mutations (3 time entries + 3 expenses)
  - `useCreateTimeEntry` - Line 201-206
  - `useUpdateTimeEntry` - Line 258-265
  - `useDeleteTimeEntry` - Line 303-308
  - `useCreateExpense` - Line 440-445
  - `useUpdateExpense` - Line 494-501
  - `useDeleteExpense` - Line 539-544

**Results:**
- ✅ Optimistic updates work correctly with query normalization
- ✅ No UI flicker (optimistic data → server data transition seamless)
- ✅ All cached queries refresh with correct server data
- ✅ Build passing, TypeScript compilation successful
